-- PR #3555 review follow-up: keep previously bound pilot products quarantined.
--
-- Preserved bindings (20261006190000) survive an unreserved disable, but
-- enabling with a DIFFERENT product overwrote policy.product_id while the
-- product-order boundary trigger consults only the current value. A
-- dedicated test product already present on a pilot order would immediately
-- become normally purchasable, with no pilot or fulfillment restrictions.
--
-- A bound product is now immutable once the pilot user has an application:
-- enabling with a different preserved product raises
-- redvault_pilot_bound_product_immutable while pilot-user applications
-- exist. Re-enabling the SAME preserved product (the disable/retry
-- recovery path) still works, and fresh bindings (preserved product_id
-- NULL) are unaffected, so this can never brick first-time enablement on
-- upgraded databases.
